        The <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, also known as the WWW and the Web, is an information space where documents
        and other web
        resources
        are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the
        Internet.[1]
        English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990
        while
        employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other
        research
        institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.

      Function

      The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction. However, the two are not the same.
      The
      <dfn>Internet</dfn> is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In contrast, the <dfn>World Wide
        Web</dfn> is a
      global
      collection
      of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs. Web resources are accessed using HTTP or HTTPS,
      which
      are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.[34]

      Viewing a web page on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the URL of the page into a web browser,
      or by
      following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background
      communication
      messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages—and to move from
      one
      web page to another through hyperlinks—came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after channel surfing), or
      'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One
      study,
      for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation
      and
      targeted navigation.[35]
      <samp>
        <pre>
        GET /home.html HTTP/1.1
        Host: www.example.org
        </pre>
      </samp>
      followed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for a basic web page might look
      like this:
      <code>
        <pre>
              &lt;html>
        
              &lt;head>
                &lt;title>www.Example.org – The World Wide Web</title>
              &lt;/head>
        
              &lt;body>
                &lt;p>The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...</p>
              &lt;/body>
        
              &lt;/html>
              </pre>
